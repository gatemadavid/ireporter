iReporter is a web application created to help Africans fight instances of corruption and neglected development in their countries.

To use the application, users have to register and login to access a panel where they will create a red flag or an intervention. Red flags are for reporting corruption while interventions are meant to request the government to help in areas such as security, healthcare, and infrastructure development.

Once users have logged in, they can see the red flags or interventions they have created, they can edit them, delete them, or update. They can also see the status of their interventions and red flags whether they have been rejected, resolved, or under investigation.
